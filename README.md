# Hey everyone...
I know this project is very naive. I believe that the main motive of hacktober fest above all is learning and making some meaningful contributions to the society. I made this project with my friend Sarthak just for time pass. But I was wondering if imagine...some day you know...there comes some open source social media application which has a far more superior UI/UX and functionality than facebook/insta/twitter combined. Just imagine how different the world would be! Like literally no ads and no manipulation of data.Just imagine a world without political/social discriminations/feuds/agressions being wiped out. Ultimate privacy to the user. No maniputation of votes or opinions. I think that day might be a dream. But let's just give it a kinda mock try. Please create good PRs and issues if I find the issues interesting I'll surely mark it as a Hacktoberfest issue. You can work on any issue technically as this repo is already under the hacktoberfest topic. Please create meaningful PRs. Let's see where this naive project reaches throghout the fest.
Cheers!




# Getting Started with Create React App
The app has been deployed at https://instagram-clone-8cfc1.web.app
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
